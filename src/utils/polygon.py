                    from one side to the next side must be all positive or
                    all negative, and their sum must equal plus-or-minus
                    one full turn (2 pi radians). Also check for too few,
                    invalid, or repeated points.
                2.  No check is explicitly done for zero internal angles
                    (180 degree direction-change angle) as this is covered
